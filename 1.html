love in you
and I've learned to love me too.
Never have I felt that I could be all that you see.<br>
It's like our hearts have intertwined and to the perfect harmony. This is why I love you because you love me.</p>

<p>And no other love will do.<br>
Every moment that you smile chases all of the pain away.<br>
Forever and a while in my heart is where you'll stay.</p>
